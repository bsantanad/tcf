    :param str name: name of the target

    :param str fs2_serial: USB serial number for the FlySwatter2 (defaults

    :param str serial_port: name of the serial port  (defaults to

    :param str ykush_url: (optional) URL for the DLWPS7 power controller
      to the YKUSH. If *None*, the YKUSH is considered always on. See
      :py:func:`conf_00_lib_pdu.dlwps7_add`.

      FIXME: take a PC object so something different than a DLWPS7 can be
      used.

    **Overview**

    To power on the target, first we power the YKUSH, then the
    Flyswatter, then the serial port and then the board itself. And thus
    we need to wait for each part to correctly show up in the system
    after we power it up (or power off). Then the system starts OpenOCD
    to connect it (via the JTAG) to the board.

    Powering on/off the YKUSH is optional, but highly recommended.

    See the :ref:`rationale <arduino101_rationale>` for this complicated
    setup.

    **Bill of materials**

    - an available port on a DLWPS7 power switch (optional)

    - a Yepkit YKUSH power-switching hub (see bill of materials in
      :py:func:`conf_00_lib_pdu.ykush_targets_add`

    - an Arduino101 (note it must have original firmware; if you need
      to reset it, follow :ref:`these instructions
      <a101_fw_upgrade>`).

    - a USB A-Male to B-female for power to the Arduino 101

    - a USB-to-TTL serial cable for the console (power)

    - three M/M jumper cables

    - A Flyswatter2 for flashing and debugging

    3. Flash a new serial number on the Flyswatter2 following the
       :ref:`instructions <fs2_serial_update>`.

    - a USB A-Male to B-female for connecting the Flyswatter to the YKush
      (power and data)

    - An ARM-JTAG 20-10 adapter miniboard and flat ribbon cable
      (https://www.olimex.com/Products/ARM/JTAG/ARM-JTAG-20-10/) to
      connect the JTAG to the Arduino101's jtag port.

    **Connecting the test target fixture**

    1. connect the Arduino's USB port to the YKUSH downstream port 3

    2. Flyswatter2 JTAG:

      a. connect the USB port to the YKUSH downstream port 1

      b. flash a new serial number on the Flyswatter2 following the
         :ref:`instructions <fs2_serial_update>`.

         This is needed to distinguish multiple Flyswatter2 JTAGs
         connected in the same system, as they all come flashed with
         the same number (*FS20000*).

      c. connect the ARM-JTAG 20-10 adapter cable to the FlySwatter2 and
         to the Arduino101.

         Note the flat ribbon cable has to be properly aligned; the
         red cable indicates pin #1. The board connectors might have a
         dot, a number *1* or some sort of marking indicating where
         pin #1 is.

         If your ribbon cable has no red cable, just choose one end as
         one and align it on both boards to be pin #1.

    3. connect the USB-to-TTY serial adapter to the YKUSH downstream
       port 2

    4. connect the USB-to-TTY serial adapter to the Arduino 101 with the
       M/M jumper cables:

       - USB FTDI Black (ground) to Arduino101's serial ground pin
       - USB FTDI White (RX) to the Arduino101' TX
       - USB FTDI Green (TX) to Arduino101's RX.
       - USB FTDI Red (power) is left open, it has 5V.

    5. connect the YKUSH to the server system and to power as
       described in :py:func:`conf_00_lib_pdu.ykush_targets_add`

    **Configuring the system for the fixture**

    1. Choose a name for the target: *arduino101-NN* (where NN is a
       number)

    2. Find the YKUSH's serial number *YKNNNNN* [plug it and run *dmesg*
       for a quick find], see :py:func:`conf_00_lib_pdu.ykush_targets_add`.

    3. Configure *udev* to add a name for the serial device that
       represents the USB-to-TTY dongle connected to the target so we can
       easily find it at ``/dev/tty-TARGETNAME``. Different options for
       USB-to-TTY dongles :ref:`with <usb_tty_serial>` or :ref:`without
       <usb_tty_sibling>` a USB serial number.

    flashing. It allows flashing the BLE core.

    .. code-block:: python

    :param str serial_port: (optional) name of the serial port
      (defaults to ``/dev/tty-NAME``)


    **Overview**

    The Arduino 101 is powered via the USB connector. The Arduino 101
    does not export a serial port over the USB connector--applications
    loaded onto it might create a USB serial port, but this is not
    necessarily so all the time.

    Thus, for ease of use this fixture connects an optional external
    USB-to-TTY dongle to the TX/RX/GND lines of the Arduino 101 that
    allows a reliable serial console to be present.

    When the serial dongle is in use, the power rail needs to first
    power up the serial dongle and then the board.

    Per this :ref:`rationale <arduino101_rationale>`, current leakage and
    full power down needs necesitate of this setup to cut all power to
    all cables connected to the board (power and serial).

    This fixture uses :class:`ttbl.tt.tt_dfu` to implement the target;
    refer to it for implementation details.


    **Bill of materials**

    - two available ports on an YKUSH power switching hub (serial
      *YKNNNNN*); only one if the serial console will not be used.
    - an Arduino 101 board
    - a USB A-Male to micro-B male cable (for board power)
    - (optional) a USB-to-TTY serial port dongle
    - (optional) three M/M jumper cables

    **Connecting the test target fixture**

    1. (if not yet connected), connect the YKUSH to the server system
       and to power as described in :py:func:`conf_00_lib_pdu.ykush_targets_add`

    2. connect the Arduino 101's USB port to the YKUSH downstream port
       *PORTNUMBER*

    3. (if a serial console will be connected) connect the USB-to-TTY
       serial adapter to the YKUSH downstream port *PORTNUMBER2*

    3. (if a serial console will be connected) connect the USB-to-TTY
       serial adapter to the Arduino 101 with the M/M jumper cables:

       - USB FTDI Black (ground) to Arduino 101's serial ground pin
         (fourth pin from the bottom)
       - USB FTDI White (RX) to the Arduino 101's TX.
       - USB FTDI Green (TX) to Arduino 101's RX.
       - USB FTDI Red (power) is left open, it has 5V.

    **Configuring the system for the fixture**

    1. Choose a name for the target: *a101-NN* (where NN is a number)

    2. (if needed) Find the YKUSH's serial number *YKNNNNN* [plug it and
       run *dmesg* for a quick find], see :py:func:`conf_00_lib_pdu.ykush_targets_add`.

    3. Find the board's :ref:`serial number <find_usb_info>`.

       Note these boards, when freshly plugged in, will only stay in
       DFU mode for *five seconds* and then boot Zephyr (or whichever
       OS they have), so the USB device will dissapear. You need to
       run the lsusb or whichever command you are using quick (or
       monitor the kernel output with *dmesg -w*).

    4. Configure *udev* to add a name for the serial device that
       represents the USB-to-TTY dongle connected to the target so we can
       easily find it at ``/dev/tty-a101-NN``. Different options for

      needed parameters.

      - Arduino Due: arduino:sam:arduino_due_x_dbg
      - Arduino Mega: arduino:avr:mega

      To find your board's FQBN, plug to your machine and run::

        $ arduino-cli board list
        Port         Type              Board Name                     FQBN                          Core
        /dev/ttyACM0 Serial Port (USB) Arduino Mega or Mega 2560      arduino:avr:mega              arduino:avr
        /dev/ttyACM1 Serial Port (USB) Arduino Due (Programming Port) arduino:sam:arduino_due_x_dbg arduino:sam

      And you will need to install the Core support with::

        $ arduino-cli core update-index
        $ arduino-cli core install COREPACKAGE

      for the user running the daemon as well as for any user building
      with the client.

    :param str serial_port: name of the serial port (defaults to
      /dev/tty-TARGETNAME).

    :param list power_rail: power rail to power on/off the board,
      which will be passed to :class:`ttbl.power.interface`.

    **Overview**

    Per this :ref:`rationale <arduino101_rationale>`, current leakage and
    full power down needs necesitate of this setup to cut all power to
    all cables connected to the board (power and serial).

    **Bill of materials**

    - an Arduino Mega board

    - a USB A-Male to B male cable (for board power, flashing and
      console)

    - (for full on power control) one available port on an YKUSH power
      switching hub (serial *YKNNNNN*) or other control

      None connecting the barrel power supply and the USB cable would
      still require a way to shut off power to the USB power supply,
      otherwise the board will not reset.

    **Connecting the test target fixture**

    Using a YKUSH:

    1. connect the Arduino USB B to the YKUSH downstream port *N*

    2. connect the YKUSH to the server system and to power as
       described in :py:func:`conf_00_lib_pdu.ykush_targets_add`

    Without a YKUSH:

    1. connect the Arduino USB B to a server's USB port

    **Configuring the system for the fixture**

    Ensure the steps to setup an :ref:`*Arduino CLI*
    <arduino_cli_setup>` flasher have been run.

    1. Choose a name for the target: *arduino-mega-NN* (where NN is a number)

    2. (if needed) Find the YKUSH's serial number *YKNNNNN* [plug it
       and run *dmesg* for a quick find], see
       :py:func:`conf_00_lib_pdu.ykush_targets_add`.

    3. Find the board's :ref:`serial number <find_usb_info>`

    4. Configure *udev* to add a name for the serial device for the
       board's serial console so it can be easily found at
       ``/dev/tty-TARGETNAME``. Follow :ref:`these instructions
       <usb_tty_serial>` using the boards' *serial number*.

    .. warning::

        Ugly magic here. The FRDMs sometimes boot into some bootloader
        upload mode (with a different USB serial number) from which the
        only way to get them out is by power-cycling it.

        So the power rail for this thing is set with a Power Controller
        object that does the power cycle itself (pc_board) and then
        another that looks for a USB device with the right serial number
        (serial_number). If it fails to find it, it executes an action
        and waits for it to show up. The action is power cycling the USB
        device with the pc_board power controller. Lastly, in the power
        rail, we have the glue that opens the serial ports to the device
        and the flasher object that start/stops OpenOCD.

        Yup, I dislike computers too.

    **Overview**

    The Quark D2000 board comes with a builtin JTAG / Flyswatter, whose
    port can be programmed. The serial port is externally provided via a
    USB-to-TTY dongle.

    However, because of this, to power the test target up the power rail
    needs to first power up the serial dongle and then the board. There
    is a delay until the internal JTAG device we can access it, thus we
    need a delay before the system starts OpenOCD to connect it (via the
    JTAG) to the board.

    Per this :ref:`rationale <arduino101_rationale>`, current leakage and
    full power down needs necesitate of this setup to cut all power to
    all cables connected to the board (power and serial).

    **Bill of materials**

    - two available ports on an YKUSH power switching hub (serial *YKNNNNN*)
    - a Quark D2000 reference board
    - a USB A-Male to micro-B male cable (for board power)
    - a USB-to-TTY serial port dongle
    - three M/M jumper cables

    **Connecting the test target fixture**

    1. connect the Quark D2000's USB-ATP port with the USB A-male to
       B-micro to YKUSH downstream port *N1* for powering the board

    2. connect the USB-to-TTY serial adapter to the YKUSH downstream
       port *N2*

    3. connect the USB-to-TTY serial adapter to the Quark D2000 with the
       M/M jumper cables:

       - USB FTDI Black (ground) to board's serial ground pin
       - USB FTDI White (RX) to the board's serial TX ping
       - USB FTDI Green (TX) to board's serial RX pin
       - USB FTDI Red (power) is left open, it has 5V.

    4. connect the YKUSH to the server system and to power as
       described in :py:func:`conf_00_lib_pdu.ykush_targets_add`

    **Configuring the system for the fixture**

    1. Choose a name for the target: *mv-NN* (where NN is a number)

    2. (if needed) Find the YKUSH's serial number *YKNNNNN* [plug it and
       run *dmesg* for a quick find], see :py:func:`conf_00_lib_pdu.ykush_targets_add`.

    3. Flash a new serial number on the Flyswatter2 following the
       :ref:`instructions <fs2_serial_update>`.

    4. Configure *udev* to add a name for the serial device that
       represents the USB-to-TTY dongle connected to the target so we can
       easily find it at ``/dev/tty-TARGETNAME``. Different options for
       USB-to-TTY dongles :ref:`with <usb_tty_serial>` or :ref:`without
       <usb_tty_sibling>` a USB serial number.

    6. Ensure the board is flashed with the Quark D2000 ROM (as
       described :ref:`here <fw_update_d2000>`).

    1. Choose a name for the target: *nrf51-NN* (where NN is a number)

    2. (if needed) Find the YKUSH's serial number *YKNNNNN* [plug it and
       run *dmesg* for a quick find], see :py:func:`conf_00_lib_pdu.ykush_targets_add`.

    3. Find the board's :ref:`serial number <find_usb_info>`

    4. Configure *udev* to add a name for the serial device for the
       board's serial console so it can be easily found at
       ``/dev/tty-TARGETNAME``. Follow :ref:`these instructions
       <usb_tty_serial>` using the boards' *serial number*.

    The Quark C1000 development board has a built-in JTAG which allows
    flashing, debugging, thus it only requires an upstream connection
    to a YKUSH power-switching hub for power, serial console and JTAG.

    This board has a USB serial number and should not require any
    flashing of the USB descriptors for setup.

    Add to a server configuration file:

    .. code-block:: python

       quark_c1000_add(name = "qc10000-NN",
                       serial_number = "SERIALNUMBER",

                       ykush_port_board = N)

    restart the server and it yields::

      $ tcf list
      local/qc10000-NN

    earlier versions of these boards can be added with the *ma_add()* and
    *ah_add()* versions of this function.

    :param str name: name of the target

    :param str serial_number: USB serial number for the Quark C1000 board

    :param str serial_port: name of the serial port  [FIXME: default to
      /dev/tty-TARGETNAME]

    :param str ykush_serial: :ref:`USB serial number
      <ykush_serial_number>` of the YKUSH hub

    :param int ykush_port_board: number of the YKUSH downstream port
      where the board power is connected.

    :param str variant: variant of ROM version and address map as
      defined in (FIXME) flasher configuration.

    **Overview**

    Per this :ref:`rationale <arduino101_rationale>`, current leakage and
    full power down needs necesitate of this setup to cut all power to
    all cables connected to the board (power and serial).

    **Bill of materials**

    - one available port on an YKUSH power switching hub (serial *YKNNNNN*)
    - a Quark C1000 reference board
    - a USB A-Male to micro-B male cable (for board power, JTAG and console)

    **Connecting the test target fixture**

    1. connect the Quark C1000's FTD_USB port with the USB A-male to
       B-micro to YKUSH downstream port *N*

    2. connect the YKUSH to the server system and to power as
       described in :py:func:`conf_00_lib_pdu.ykush_targets_add`

    **Configuring the system for the fixture**

    1. Choose a name for the target: *qc10000-NN* (where NN is a number)

    2. (if needed) Find the YKUSH's serial number *YKNNNNN* [plug it and
       run *dmesg* for a quick find], see :py:func:`conf_00_lib_pdu.ykush_targets_add`.

    3. Find the board's :ref:`serial number <find_usb_info>`

    4. Configure *udev* to add a name for the serial device for the
       board's serial console so it can be easily found at
       ``/dev/tty-TARGETNAME``. Follow :ref:`these instructions
       <usb_tty_serial>` using the boards' *serial number*.

       Note, **however** that these boards might present two serial
       ports to the system, one of which later converts to another
       interface. So in order to avoid configuration issues, the right
       port has to be explicitly specified with `ENV{ID_PATH} == "*:1.1"`::

         # Force second interface, first is for JTAG/update
         SUBSYSTEM == "tty", ENV{ID_SERIAL_SHORT} == "IN0521621", \
           ENV{ID_PATH} == "*:1.1", \
           SYMLINK += "tty-TARGETNAME"

      where the board power is connected.

    :param str target_type: the target type "sam_e70_xplained"
      or "sam_v71_xplained"

    **Overview**

    Per this :ref:`rationale <arduino101_rationale>`, current leakage and
    full power down needs necesitate of this setup to cut all power to
    all cables connected to the board (power and serial).

    **Bill of materials**

    - a SAM E70 or V71 xplained board
    - a USB A-Male to micro-B male cable (for board power, JTAG and console)
    - one available port on an YKUSH power switching hub (serial *YKNNNNN*)

    **Connecting the test target fixture**

    1. Ensure the SAM E70 is properly setup:

       Using Atmel's *SAM-BA* In-system programmer, change the boot
       sequence and reset the board in case there is a bad image;
       this utility can be also used to recover the board in case
       it gets stuck.

       A. Download from `Atmel's website
          <http://www.atmel.com/tools/atmelsam-bain-systemprogrammer.aspx>`_
          (registration needed) and install.

          .. note:: This is **not** open source software

       B. Close the erase jumper *erase* (in SAMEv70 that's J200 and
          in SAMEv71 it is J202; in both cases, it is located above the
          CPU when you rotate the board so you can read the CPU's
          labeling in a normal orientation).

       C. Connect the USB cable to the taget's *target USB* port (the
          one next to the Ethernet connector) and to a USB port that
          is known to be powered on.

          Ensure power is on by verifying the orange led lights on on
          the Ethernet RJ-45 connector.

       D. Wait 10 seconds

       E. Open the erase jumper J202 to stop erasing

       F. Open *SAM-BA* 2.16

          Note on Fedora 25 you need to run *sam-ba_64* from the
          SAM-BA package.

       G. Select which serial port is that of the SAM e70 connected to
          the system. Use *lsusb.py -ciu* to locate the *tty/ttyACM*
          device assigned to your board::

            $ lsusb.py -ciu
            ...
            2-1      03eb:6124 02  2.00  480MBit/s 100mA 2IFs (Atmel Corp. at91sam SAMBA bootloader)
             2-1:1.0   (IF) 02:02:00 1EP  (Communications:Abstract (modem):None) cdc_acm tty/ttyACM2
             2-1:1.1   (IF) 0a:00:00 2EPs (CDC Data:) cdc_acm
            ...

          (in this example ``/dev/tty/ttyACM2``).

       H. Select board *at91same70-explained*, click connect.

       I. chose the flash tab and in the scripts
          drop down menu, choose *boot from Flash (GPNVM1)* and then
          *execute*.

       J. Exit *SAM-BA*

    2. connect the SAM E70/V71's *Debug USB* port with the USB
       A-male to B-micro to YKUSH downstream port *N*

    3. connect the YKUSH to the server system and to power as
       described in :py:func:`conf_00_lib_pdu.ykush_targets_add`

    **Configuring the system for the fixture**

    1. Choose a name for the target: *sam-e70-NN* (where NN is a number)

    2. (if needed) Find the YKUSH's serial number *YKNNNNN* [plug it and
       run *dmesg* for a quick find], see :py:func:`conf_00_lib_pdu.ykush_targets_add`.

    3. Find the board's :ref:`serial number <find_usb_info>`

    4. Configure *udev* to add a name for the serial device for the
       board's serial console so it can be easily found at
       ``/dev/tty-TARGETNAME``. Follow :ref:`these instructions
       <usb_tty_serial>` using the board's *serial number*.

    """**Configure a tinyTILE for the fixture described below.**

    The tinyTILE is a miniaturization of the Arduino/Genuino 101 (see
    https://www.zephyrproject.org/doc/boards/x86/tinytile/doc/board.html).

    The fixture used by this configuration uses a YKUSH hub for power
    switching, no debug/JTAG interface and allows for an
    optional external serial port using an USB-to-TTY serial adapter.

    Add to a server configuration file:

    .. code-block:: python

       tinytile_add("ti-NN", "SERIALNUMBER", "YKNNNNN", PORTNUMBER,
                    [ykush_port_serial = N2,]
                    [serial_port = "/dev/tty-NAME"])

    restart the server and it yields::

      $ tcf list
      local/ti-NN

    :param str name: name of the target

    :param str usb_serial_number: USB serial number for the tinyTILE

    :param str ykush_serial: :ref:`USB serial number
      <ykush_serial_number>` of the YKUSH hub

    :param int ykush_port_board: number of the YKUSH downstream port
      where the board is connected.

    :param int ykush_port_serial: (optional) number of the YKUSH
       downstream port where the board's serial port is connected.

    :param str serial_port: (optional) name of the serial port
      (defaults to ``/dev/tty-NAME``)


    **Overview**

    The tinyTILE is powered via the USB connector. The tinyTILE does
    not export a serial port over the USB connector--applications
    loaded onto it might create a USB serial port, but this is not
    necessarily so all the time.

    Thus, for ease of use this fixture connects an optional external
    USB-to-TTY dongle to the TX/RX/GND lines of the tinyTILE that
    allows a reliable serial console to be present. To allow for
    proper MCU board reset, this serial port has to be also power
    switched on the same YKUSH hub (to avoid ground derivations).

    For the serial console output to be usableq, the Zephyr Apps
    configuration has to be altered to change the console to said
    UART. The client side needs to be aware of that (via
    configuration, for example, to the Zephyr App Builder).

    When the serial dongle is in use, the power rail needs to first
    power up the serial dongle and then the board.

    Per this :ref:`rationale <arduino101_rationale>`, current leakage and
    full power down needs necesitate of this setup to cut all power to
    all cables connected to the board (power and serial).

    This fixture uses :class:`ttbl.tt.tt_dfu` to implement the target;
    refer to it for implementation details.

    **Bill of materials**

    - two available ports on an YKUSH power switching hub (serial
      *YKNNNNN*); only one if the serial console will not be used.
    - a tinyTILE board
    - a USB A-Male to micro-B male cable (for board power)
    - a USB-to-TTY serial port dongle
    - three M/M jumper cables

    **Connecting the test target fixture**

    1. (if not yet connected), connect the YKUSH to the server system
       and to power as described in :py:func:`conf_00_lib_pdu.ykush_targets_add`

    2. connect the Tiny Tile's USB port to the YKUSH downstream port
       N1

    3. (if a serial console will be connected) connect the USB-to-TTY
       serial adapter to the YKUSH downstream port N2

    3. (if a serial console will be connected) connect the USB-to-TTY
       serial adapter to the Tiny Tile with the M/M jumper cables:

       - USB FTDI Black (ground) to Tiny Tile's serial ground pin
         (fourth pin from the bottom)
       - USB FTDI White (RX) to the Tiny Tile's TX.
       - USB FTDI Green (TX) to Tiny Tile's RX.
       - USB FTDI Red (power) is left open, it has 5V.

    **Configuring the system for the fixture**

    1. Choose a name for the target: *ti-NN* (where NN is a number)

    2. (if needed) Find the YKUSH's serial number *YKNNNNN* [plug it and
       run *dmesg* for a quick find], see :py:func:`conf_00_lib_pdu.ykush_targets_add`.

    3. Find the board's :ref:`serial number <find_usb_info>`.

       Note these boards, when freshly plugged in, will only stay in
       DFU mode for *five seconds* and then boot Zephyr (or whichever
       OS they have), so the USB device will dissapear. You need to
       run the lsusb or whichever command you are using quick (or
       monitor the kernel output with *dmesg -w*).

    4. Configure *udev* to add a name for the serial device that
       represents the USB-to-TTY dongle connected to the target so we can
       easily find it at ``/dev/tty-TARGETNAME``. Different options for
       USB-to-TTY dongles :ref:`with <usb_tty_serial>` or :ref:`without
       <usb_tty_sibling>` a USB serial number.
