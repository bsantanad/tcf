class vlan_pci(ttbl.power.impl_c):
    """Power controller to implement networks on the server side.

    Supports:

    - connecting the server to a physical net physical networks with
      physical devices (normal or VLAN networks)

    - creating internal virtual networks with `macvtap
      http://virt.kernelnewbies.org/MacVTap` so VMs running in the
      host can get into said networks.

      When a physical device is also present, it is used as the upper
      device (instead of a bridge) so traffic can flow from physical
      targets to the virtual machines in the network.

    - *tcpdump* capture of network traffic

    This behaves as a power control implementation that when turned:

    - on: sets up the interfaces, brings them up, start capturing

    - off: stops all the network devices, making communication impossible.


    **Capturing with tcpdump**

    Can be enabled setting the target's property *tcpdump*::

      $ tcf property-set TARGETNAME tcpdump FILENAME

    this will have the target dump all traffic capture to a file
    called *FILENAME* in the daemon file storage area for the user who
    owns the target. The file can then be recovered with::

      $ tcf store-download FILENAME

    *FILENAME* must be a valid file name, with no directory
    components.

    .. note:: Note this requires the property *tcpdump* being
              registered in the configuration with
    
              >>> ttbl.test_target.properties_user.add('tcpdump')

              so normal users can set/unset it.

    Example configuration (see :ref:`naming networks <bp_naming_networks>`):

    >>> target = ttbl.test_target("nwa")
    >>> target.interface_add("power", ttbl.power.interface(vlan_pci()))
    >>> ttbl.config.interconnect_add(
    >>>     target,
    >>>     tags = {
    >>>         'ipv4_addr': '192.168.97.1',
    >>>         'ipv4_prefix_len': 24,
    >>>         'ipv6_addr': 'fd:99:61::1',
    >>>         'ipv6_prefix_len': 104,
    >>>         'mac_addr': '02:61:00:00:00:01:',
    >>>     })

    Now QEMU targets (for example), can declare they are part of this
    network and upon start, create a tap interface for themselves::

      $ ip link add link _bnwa name tnwaTARGET type macvtap mode bridge
      $ ip link set tnwaTARGET address 02:01:00:00:00:IC_INDEX up

    which then is given to QEMU as an open file descriptor::

      -net nic,model=virtio,macaddr=02:01:00:00:00:IC_INDEX
      -net tap,fd=FD

    (targets implemented by
    :func:`conf_00_lib_pos.target_qemu_pos_add` and
    :py:func:`conf_00_lib_mcu.target_qemu_zephyr_add` with VMs
    implement this behaviour).

    Notes:

    - keep target names short, as they will be used to generate
      network interface names and those are limited in size (usually to
      about 12 chars?), eg tnwaTARGET comes from *nwa* being the
      name of the network target/interconnect, TARGET being the target
      connected to said interconnect.

    - IC_INDEX: is the index of the TARGET in the interconnect/network;
      it is recommended, for simplicty to make them match with the mac
      address, IP address and target name, so for example:

      - targetname: pc-04
      - ic_index: 04
      - ipv4_addr: 192.168.1.4
      - ipv6_addr: fd:00:01:::4
      - mac_addr: 02:01:00:00:00:04

    If a tag named *mac_addr* is given, containing the MAC address
    of a physical interface in the system, then it will be taken over
    as the point of connection to external targets. Connectivity from
    any virtual machine in this network will be extended to said
    network interface, effectively connecting the physical and virtual
    targets.

    .. warning:: DISABLE Network Manager's (or any other network
                 manager) control of this interface, otherwise it will
                 interfere with it and network will not operate.

                 Follow :ref:`these steps <howto_nm_disable_control>`

    System setup:

    - *ttbd* must be ran with CAP_NET_ADMIN so it can create network
       interfaces. For that, either add to systemd's
       ``/etc/systemd/system/ttbd@.service``::

         CapabilityBoundingSet = CAP_NET_ADMIN
         AmbientCapabilities = CAP_NET_ADMIN

      or as root, give ttbd the capability::

        # setcap cap_net_admin+pie /usr/bin/ttbd

    - *udev*'s */etc/udev/rules.d/ttbd-vlan*::

        SUBSYSTEM == "macvtap", ACTION == "add", DEVNAME == "/dev/tap*", \
            GROUP = "ttbd", MODE = "0660"

      This is needed so the tap devices can be accessed by user
      *ttbd*, which is the user that runs the daemon.

      Remember to reload *udev*'s configuration with `udevadm control
      --reload-rules`.

      This is already taken care by the RPM installation.

    **Fixture setup**

    - Select a network interface to use (it can be a USB or PCI
      interface); find out it's MAC address with *ip link show*.

    - add the tag *mac_addr* with said address to the tags of the
      target object that represents the network to which which said
      interface is to be connected; for example, for a network called
      *nwc*

      >>> target = ttbl.test_target("nwa")
      >>> target.interface_add("power", ttbl.power.interface(vlan_pci()))
      >>> ttbl.config.interconnect_add(
      >>>     target,
      >>>     tags = {
      >>>         'ipv4_addr': '192.168.97.1',
      >>>         'ipv4_prefix_len': 24,
      >>>         'ipv6_addr': 'fd:00:61::1',
      >>>         'ipv6_prefix_len': 104,
      >>>         'mac_addr': "a0:ce:c8:00:18:73",
      >>>     })

      or for an existing network (such as the configuration's default
      *nwa*):

      .. code-block:: python

         # eth dongle mac 00:e0:4c:36:40:b8 is assigned to NWA
         ttbl.test_target.get('nwa').tags_update(dict(mac_addr = '00:e0:4c:36:40:b8'))

      Furthermore, default networks *nwa*, *nwb* and *nwc* are defined
      to have a power control rail (versus an individual power
      controller), so it is possible to add another power controller
      to, for example, power on or off a network switch:

      .. code-block:: python

         ttbl.test_target.get('nwa').pc_impl.append(
             ttbl.pc.dlwps7("http://USER:PASSWORD@sp5/8"))

      This creates a power controller to switch on or off plug #8 on
      a Digital Loggers Web Power Switch named *sp5* and makes it part
      of the *nwa* power control rail. Thus, when powered on, it will
      bring the network up up and also turn on the network switch.

    - add the tag *vlan* to also be a member of an ethernet VLAN
      network (requires also a *mac_addr*):

      >>> target = ttbl.test_target("nwa")
      >>> target.interface_add("power", ttbl.power.interface(vlan_pci()))
      >>> ttbl.config.interconnect_add(
      >>>     target,
      >>>     tags = {
      >>>         'ipv4_addr': '192.168.97.1',
      >>>         'ipv4_prefix_len': 24,
      >>>         'ipv6_addr': 'fd:00:61::1',
      >>>         'ipv6_prefix_len': 104,
      >>>         'mac_addr': "a0:ce:c8:00:18:73",
      >>>         'vlan': 30,
      >>>     })

      in this case, all packets in the interface described by MAC addr
      *a0:ce:c8:00:18:73* with tag *30*.

    - lastly, for each target connected to that network, update it's
      tags to indicate it:

      .. code-block:: python

         ttbl.test_target.get('TARGETNAME-NN').tags_update(
             {
               'ipv4_addr': "192.168.10.30",
               'ipv4_prefix_len': 24,
               'ipv6_addr': "fd:00:10::30",
               'ipv6_prefix_len': 104,
             },
             ic = 'nwc')

    By convention, the server is .1, the QEMU Linux virtual machines
    are set from .2 to .10 and the QEMU Zephyr virtual machines from
    .30 to .45. Physical targets are set to start at 100.

    Note the networks for targets and infrastructure :ref:`have to be
    kept separated <separated_networks>`.
