Control power to targets and general control for relays, buttons and jumpers
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This interface provides means to power on/off targets and the invidual
components that compose the power rail of a target.

The interface is implemented by :class:`ttbl.power.interface` needs to
be attached to a target with :meth:`ttbl.test_target.interface_add`::

>>> ttbl.test_target.get(NAME).interface_add(
>>>     "power",
>>>     ttbl.power.interface(
>>>         component0,
>>>         component1,
>>>         ...
>>>     )

Generally, this interface can also be used to control any
instrumentation that has binary states (on/off, true/false,
connected/disconnected, pressed/released, etc..) such as:

- relays
- buttons
- jumpers (controlled by a relay)

by convention, the *buttons* and *jumpers* interfaces are exposed with
those names; thus, in a configuration :ref:`configuration file
<ttbd_configuration>`::

>>> ttbl.test_target.get(NAME).interface_add(
>>>     "buttons",
>>>     ttbl.power.interface(
>>>         power = ttbl.usbrly08b.pc("24234", 3),
>>>         reset = ttbl.usbrly08b.pc("24234", 4),
>>>         ...
>>>     )

would add two buttons, power and reset, controlled by a
:class:`USBRLY08B <ttbl.usbrly08b.pc>` relay bank (by wiring the NO and
NC lines through the button so that turning on/closing the relay
effectively presses the button).

Any other mechanism (and driver) to act on jumpers or buttons can be
implemented to provide the on/off operation that translates into
button press/release or jumper close/open.

Each component is an instance of a subclass of
:class:`ttbl.power.impl_c`, which implements the actual control over
the power unit, such as:

- PDU socket: :class:`Digital Logger's Web Power Switch
  7<ttbl.pc.dlwps7>`, :class:`YKush <ttbl.pc_ykush.ykush>` power
  switch hub, raritan EMX
- relays: :class:`USB-RLY08b <ttbl.usbrly08b.pc>`
- control over IPMI: :class:`ttbl.ipmi.pci`

Also power components are able to:

- start / stop daemons in the server (*socat*, *rsync*, *qemu*,
  *openocd*...)

- :class:`delay <ttbl.pc.delay>` the power on/off sequence

- wait for some particular conditions to happen: a file
  :class:`dissapearing <ttbl.pc.delay_til_file_gone>` or
  :class:`appearing <ttbl.pc.delay_til_file_appears>`,
  :class:`a shell command running and returning a value
  <ttbl.power.delay_til_shell_cmd_c>` or a USB device is
  :class:`detected <ttbl.pc.delay_til_usb_device>` in the system

.. _ttbd_power_explicit:

Explicit vs normal power components
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Power components can be declared as:

  - **normal** (default): upon running whole rail power **on** or
    **off** sequences, they are always acted upon.

  - **explicit**: upon running a whole rail power **on** or **off**
    sequence, they will be skipped, unless the *explicit* option is
    given.

  - **explicit/on**: upon running a whole rail power **on** sequence,
    they will be skipped unless the *explicit* option is given.

  - **explicit/off**: upon running a whole rail power **off**
    sequence, they will be skipped unless the *explicit* option is
    given.

Thus, an *explicit* power components will be only acted upon when we
explicitly power them on/off.

Use models for the *explicit* tagging:

- a target is powered by components A and B. Component A takes a
  long time to power up and can be left on, since the actual power
  control to the target depends on also on B being on and B is more
  responsive.

  Component A would be declared as *explicit off*.

  This can be applied for example to servers powered via a PDU for AC
  power but whose actual state can be governed via a BMC using the
  IPMI protocol.

- Invasive instrumentation C connected to a target that is to be used
  only in certain ocassions but has to be powered off for normal use.

  Component C would be declared as *explicit on*.

To configure a component at the configuration level, the :attr:impl_cexplicit
attribute can be set to:

- *None* for normal behaviour

- *both* explicit for both powering on and off

- *on* explicit for powering on

- *off* explicit for powering off

this can be used either in the intialization sequence or afterwards:

>>> pc = ttbl.power.socat_pc(ADDR1, ADDR2)
>>> pc.explicit = 'both'

.. _ttbd_power_states:

Overall power state and explicit power components
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Deciding what is the overall power state has a few nuances to take
into account, especially when explicit power components are taken into
account.

The target is:

- **fully on**: when **all** the power components (including those
  tagged as *explicit* and *explicit/on*) are reporting *on* or *n/a*

- *partial on*: when **all** the power components (excluding those
  tagged as *explicit* and *explicit/on*) reports *on* and some (but
  not all) of those tagged as *explict* and *explicit/on* are
  on.

  This might be an inconsistent state, since some of the explicit
  components might not allow the target to operate normally.

- **on**: when **all** the power components (except those tagged as
   **explicit** and **explicit/on**) are reporting *on* or *n/a*

- *partial off*: when **any** (but not all) power components
  (excluding those tagged as *explicit* and *explicit/on*) reports
  *off*

- *off*: when **all** power components (excluding those tagged as
  *explicit* and *explicit/off*) report *off*

- **fully off**: when **all** the power components (including those
  tagged as *explicit* and *explicit/off*) report *off*.

Note the computation of *is the target* off depends on the context:

- for a remote user:

  - *fully on* might be impossible to reach for operation of the
    target, as some explicit/on power components might not allow the
    target to work normally (eg: invasive instrumentation that disallows
    normal operation).

  - *partial on* like *fully on*, this might be an inconsistent state,
    since some of the explicit components might not allow the target
    to operate normally.

    This might be used for non-common circumnstances to administer,
    diagnose or do non typical work on the targets.

  - *on* means the target should operate as it'd be normally

  - *partial off* likely means the not everything the target needs to
    work is operative; to bring it to operation most likely it shall
    be power cycled (take to off, then power on).

  - *off* means the target is powered off as it'd be normally

  - *partial off* likely means the not everything the target needs to
    work is operative; to bring it to operation most likely it shall
    be power cycled (take to off, then power on).

- for a daemon powering off unused infrastructure, it should take to
  *off* anything on *partially off*, *on* and *fully on* and after a
  longer count, maybe bring to *fully off*.

As a convenience, the system publishes in the inventory the data
*interfaces.power.state* as *true* if *on*. Otherwise, the state is
not published and must be assumed as *off* or *fully off*.

    """Implementation interface to drive a  power component

    A power component is an individual entity that provides one of the
    pieces of a power rail needed to power up a target.

    It can be powered on, off and it's state can be acquired.

    A driver is made by subclassing this object, implementing the
    :meth:`on`, :meth:`off` and :meth:`get` methods and then adding
    it to a power interface :class:`ttbl.power.interface` which is
    then attached to a target.

    Drivers implement the specifics to run the switches PDUs, relays,
    etc

    Note these are designed to be as stateless as possible; in most
    cases all the state needed can be derived from the *target* and
    *component* parameters passed to the methods.

    Remember no information can be stored *self* or *target* as the
    next call can come in another daemon implementing the same
    target. For storage, use the target's *fsdb* interface.

    **ALL** the methods have to be blocking, so the operation is
    supposed to be completed and the status has to have been changed
    by the time the call returns. If the operation cannot be trusted
    to be blocking, set the *paranoid* parameter to *True* so the
    power interface will confirm the change has re-happened and
    enforce it again.

    :param bool paranoid: don't trust the operation is really
      blocking, as it should, so double check the state changed happen
      and retry if not.

      component shall be only turned on or off when explicitly named in
      a power rail. See :ref:ttbd_power_explicit.

class socat_pc(daemon_c):
    """
    Generic power component that starts/stops socat as daemon

    This class is meant to be subclassed for an implementation passing
    the actual addresses to use.

    :param str address1: first address for socat; will be templated
      with *%(FIELD)s* to the target's keywords and anything added in
      :data:`daemon_c.kws`.
    :param str address2: second address for socat; templated as
      *address1*
    :param dict env_add: variables to add to the environment when
      running socat
    :param float precheck_wait: seconds to wait once starting before
      checking if the daemon is running; sometimes it dies after we
      check, so it is good to give it a wait.

    Other arguments as to :class:ttbl.power.impl_c.

    This object (or what is derived from it) can be passed to a power
    interface for implementation, eg:

    >>> ttbl.test_target.get('TARGETNAME').interface_add(
    >>>     "power",
    >>>     ttbl.power.interface(
    >>>         ttbl.power.socat_pc(ADDR1, ADDR2)
    >>>     )
    >>> )

    Upon power up, the *socat* daemon will be started, with it's
    current directory set to the target's state directory and a log
    file called after the component (*NAME-socat.log*). When powering
    off, the daemon is stopped.

    Anything coming of the *ipmitool's* *stderr* is sent to a file
    called *NAME-socat.stderr*.

    Specifying addresses is very specific to the usage that it is to
    be done of it, but for example:

    - ``PTY,link=console-%(component)s.write,rawer!!CREATE:console-%(component)s.read``

      creates a PTY which will pass whatever is written to
      ``console-COMPONENT.write`` to the second address and whatever
      is read from it to ``console-COMPONENT.read`` (!! serves like a
      bifurcator).

      Note you need to use *rawer* to ensure a clean pipe, otherwise
      the PTY later might add \\rs.

    - ``/dev/ttyS0,creat=0,rawer,b115200,parenb=0,cs8,bs1``

      opens a serial port and writes to it whatever is written to
      ``console-COMPONENT.write`` and anything that is read from the
      serial port will be appended to file ``console-COMPONENT.read``.

    - ``EXEC:'/usr/bin/ipmitool -H HOSTNAME -U USERNAME -E -I lanplus sol activate',sighup,sigint,sigquit``

      runs the program *ipmitool*, writes to *stdin* whatever is
      written to *console-COMPONENT.write* and whatever comes out of
      *stdout* is written to *console-COMPONENT.read*.

    Be wary of adding options such *crnl* to remove extra CRs (\\r)
    before the newline (\\n) when using to implement consoles. The
    console channels are meant to be completely transparent.

    For examples, look at :class:`ttbl.console.serial_pc` and
    :class:`ttbl.ipmi.sol_console_pc`.

    ** Catchas and Tricks for debugging **

    Sometimes it just dies and we are left wondering

    - prepend to *EXEC* *strace -fo /tmp/strace.log*, as in::

        EXEC:'strace -fo /tmp/strace.log COMMANDTHATDIES'

      find information in server's ``/tmp/strace.log`` when power
      cycling or enable top level calling under strace; it gets
      helpful.
