Power control module to start a dnsmasq daemon
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A DNSMASQ daemon is created that can be attached to a network
interface to:

- resolve DNS requests for all the targets attached to a test network 
- serves DHCP requests to hosts in the interconnect's network
- serves TFTP files from TARGETDIR/tftp.root

Note this will conflict with other DHCP or TFTP servers running in the
same hosts, but it will *only* serve in the interface it is associated
to the interconnect target it is made a power rail of.

Pending:

- IPv6 support not very tested.

- allow to switch which functionalities are needed

  - tftp on/off

  - default route on/off

- allowing adding more names/IP-addresses to the database at will

    """Start / stop a dnsmasq daemon to resolve DNS requests to a given
    network interface

    This is meant to be used in the power rail of an interconnect
    target that represents a network to which the server is physically
    connected.

    Upon power on, it collects the list of targets connecte to the
    interconnect and creates IPv4 and IPv6 address records for them
    (short form *TARGETNAME*, longform *TARGETNAME.INTERCONNECTNAME*);
    the dnsmasq daemon will then resolve those names from queries from
    the targets.

    For example: the server configures the interconnect *nwa*, to
      which it has physical access on a given interface on IP address
      192.168.97.1 (as configured in the interconnect's tags)::

        $ tcf list -vv nwa
        server/nwa
          id: nwa
          ipv4_addr: 192.168.97.1
          ...

      Target *qu-90a* is connected to network *nwa*, and thus it
      declares in its tags *interconnects.nwa*::

        $ tcf list -vv qu-90a
        server/qu-90a
          id: qu-90a
          interconnects.nwa.ipv4_addr: 192.168.97.90

      DNSMASQ (on 192.168.97.1#53) will resolve *qu-90a.nwa* when
      queried from inside the network *nwa* to 192.168.97.90.

    Use in the cpower rail to an interconnect, it won't work with a
    target that does not define tags *ipv4_addr*.
