Interface for common debug operations
-------------------------------------

A target's multiple components can expose each debugging interfaces;
these allow some low level control of CPUs, access to JTAG
functionality, etc in an abstract way based on capability.

Debugging can be started or stopped; depending on the driver this
might mean some things are done to allow that debugging support to
happen. In some components it might need a power cycle.

Each component can have its own :class:`driver <impl_c>` or one driver
might service multiple components (eg: in asymetrical SMP systems)
serviced by OpenOCD.

When the debug support for multiple components is implemented by the
same driver, a single call will be made into it with the list of
components it applies to.

The client side is implemented by :class:`target.debug
<tcfl.target_ext_debug.extension>`.

    Driver interface for a component's debugging capabilities

    The debug interface supports multiple components which will be
    called for the top level debug operations; they are implemented by
    an instance subclassed from this interface.

    Objects that implement the debug interface then can be passed to
    the debug interface as implementations; for example, the QEMU
    driver exposes a debug interface and thus:

    >>> qemu_pc = ttbl.qemu.pc(...)
    >>> ...
    >>> target.interface_add("debug", ttbl.debug.interface(
    >>>   ( "x86", qemu_pc )))

    this assumes that the QEMU driver object *qemu_pc* has been
    instantiated to implement an *x86* virtual machine; thus the debug
    control for the virtual machine *x86* is registered with the
    *debug* interface.

    When debug is started while the target is executing, the target
    shall not be stopped and the debugging stub shall permit a
    debugger to connect and interrupt the target upon connection.

    Each target provides its own debug methodolody; to find out how to
    connect, issue a debug-gdb command to find out where to connect
    to.

    When a target has this capability, the interface can be added to
    the target specifying which actual object derived from
    :class:`impl_c` implements the functionality, eg, for a target
    based on QEMU, QEMU provides a debug interface:
