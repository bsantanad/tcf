      usually a USB serial number.

    :param str board: name of the board we are connecting against;
      this has to be defined in :data:`boards` or
      :data:`board_synonyms`.

    :param bool debug: (optional) run OpenOCD in debugging mode,
      printing extra information to the log (default *False*).

    *target ID*

    OpenOCD will operate on targets (different to TCF's targets);
    these might one or more CPUs in the debugged system.  Each has an
    ID, which by default is zero.

    *component to OpenOCD target mapping*

    Each component configured in the target addition maps to an
    OpenOCD target in *boards[X][targets]*.

    **OLD OLD**

    This is a flasher object that uses OpenOCD to provide flashing
    and GDB server support.

    The object starts an OpenOCD instance (that runs as a daemon)
    -- it does this behaving as a power-control implementation
    that is plugged at the end of the power rail.

    .. note: OpenOCD will crash randomly for unknown reasons; this
      implementation makes the power system think the target is
      off when OpenOCD has crashed, so it can be restarted.

    To execute commands, it connects to the daemon via TCL and
    runs them using the ``'capture "OPENOCDCOMMAND"'`` TCL command
    (FIXME: is there a better way?). The telnet port is open for
    manual debugging (check your firewall! **no passwords!**); the GDB
    ports are also available.

    The class knows the configuration settings for different
    boards (as given in the `board_name` parameter. It is also
    possible to point it to specific OpenOCD paths when different
    builds / versions need to be used.

    Note how entry points from the flasher_c class all start with
    underscore. Functions ``__SOMETHING()`` are those that have to be
    called with a ``_expect_mgr`` context taken [see comments
    on ``__send_command`` for the reason.

    :param str board_name: name of the board to use, to select
      proper configuration parameters. Needs to be declared in
      *ttbl.flasher.openocd_c._boards*.

    When starting OpenOCD, run a reset halt immediately after.
    This is used when flashing, as we power cycle before to try
    to have the target in a proper state--we want to avoid it
    running any code that might alter the state again.

    Now, this is used in combination with another setting,
    board specific, that says if the reset has to be done or
    not in method :meth:_power_on_do_openocd_verify().

    But why? Because some Quark SE targets, when put in deep
    sleep mode, OpenOCD is unable to reset halt them, returning
    something like:

      > reset halt
      JTAG tap: quark_se.cltap tap/device found: 0x0e765013 (mfg: 0x009 (Intel), part: 0xe765, ver: 0x0)
      Enabling arc core tap
      JTAG tap: quark_se.arc-em enabled
      Enabling quark core tap
      JTAG tap: quark_se.quark enabled
      target is still running!
      target running, halt it first
      quark_se_target_reset could not write memory
      in procedure 'reset' called at file "command.c", line 787

    So what we are trying to do, and it is a *horrible hack*,
    is to hopefully catch the CPU before it gets into that
    mode, and when it does, it bails out if it fails to reset
    and restarts OpenOCD and maybe (maybe) it at some point
    will get it.

    Now, this is by NO MEANS a proper fix. The right fix would
    be for OpenOCD to be able to reset in any circumstance
    (which it doesn't). An alternative would be to find some
    kind of memory location OpenOCD can write to that will take
    the CPU out of whichever state it gets stuck at which we
    can run when we see that.

    Zephyr's sample samples/board/quark_se/power_mgr is very
    good at making this happen.
