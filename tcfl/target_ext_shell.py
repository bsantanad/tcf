Run commands a shell available on a target's serial console
-----------------------------------------------------------

Also allows basic file transmission over serial line.

Shell prompts
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Waiting for a shell prompt is quite a harder problem that it seems to
be at the beginning.

Problems:

- Background processes or (in the serial console, the kernel) printing
  lines in the middle.

  Even with line buffered output, when there are different CRLF
  conventions, a misplaced newline or carriage return can break havoc.

  As well, if a background process / kernel prints a message after the
  prompt is printed, a ``$`` will no longer match. The ``\Z`` regex
  operator cannot be used for the same reason.

- CRLF conventions make it harder to use the ``^`` and ``$`` regex
  expression metacharacteds.

- ANSI sequences, human doesn't see/notice them, but to the computer /
  regular expression they are 

Thus, resorting to match a single line is the best bet; however, it is
almost impossible to guarantee that it is the last one as the multiple
formats of prompts could be matching other text.

        :param str cmd: (optional) command to run; if none, only the
          expectations are waited for (if *expect* is not set, then
          only the prompt is expected).
        :param expect: (optional) output to expect (string or
          regex) before the shell prompt. This an also be a list of
          things to expect (in the given order)
        :param prompt_regex: (optional) output to expect (string or
          regex) as a shell prompt, which is always to be found at the
          end. Defaults to the preconfigured shell prompt (NUMBER $).
        :param bool output: (optional, default False) return the
          output of the command to the console; note the output
          includes the execution of the command itself.
        :param bool output_filter_crlf: (optional, default True) if we
          are returning output, filter out ``\\r\\n`` to whatever our CRLF
          convention is.
        :param bool trim: if ``output`` is True, trim the command and
          the prompt from the beginning and the end of the output
          respectively (True)
        :param str console: (optional) on which console to run;
          (defaults to *None*, the default console).
        :param str origin: (optional) when reporting information about
          this expectation, what origin shall it list, eg:

          - *None* (default) to get the current caller
          - *commonl.origin_get(2)* also to get the current caller
          - *commonl.origin_get(1)* also to get the current function

          or something as:

          >>> "somefilename:43"
        :returns str: if ``output`` is true, a string with the output
          of the command.

          .. warning:: if ``output_filter_crlf`` is False, this output
             will be ``\\r\\n`` terminated and it will be confusing because
             regex won't work right away. A quick, dirty, fix

             >>> output = output.replace('\\r\\n', '\\n')

             ``output_filter_crlf`` enabled replaces this output with

             >>> output = output.replace('\\r\\n', target.console.crlf[CONSOLENAME])
